Project Description - Galaga
Group Members: Dylan Bohn, Matt Vierow, Bethanie Hackett

Our GBA game will be a replication of the popular arcade game Galaga.
- Description: The game is set in space, where the player controls a single starfighter that is fixed to the bottom of the screen, but can move horizontally
(left and right). Enemy aliens spawn at the top of the screen and move downwards towards the player's starfighter. The starfighter is able to shoot
projectiles directly up, and if they hit an alien, then the alien dies. However, if an alien reaches the bottom of the screen and collides with the 
starfighter, then the starfighter will be destroyed and the player loses. The player's goal is to survive against the aliens for as long as possible.

Implementation overview: Following the project requirements, our implementation of Galaga will include a scrolling, tiled background, multiple sprites, and assembly code functions. 
- Scrolling, tiled background: a space background that will scroll vertically
- Sprites: sprites for the starfighter and various alien species; the sprites will come from a publicly available image of Galaga sprites
- Assembly code functions:
